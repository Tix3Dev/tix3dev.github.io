## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yves aka Tix3Dev.<br/>
I am a 16-year-old computer science/engineering enthusiast from Switzerland.
Currently, I am really passionate about OSDev.
My interests aren't just limited to programming but rather STEM as a whole.

So as you can probably tell, I am planning to write about all kinds of STEM related topics. 

## Education ðŸ”¬

I am still in school but eventually my goal is to study computer science or computer engineering.

## Open-Source Projects ðŸŒŸ

I have been using GitHub only since the end of 2020 (although I've started programming way before) so the amount of open source projects isn't too spectacular so far.
