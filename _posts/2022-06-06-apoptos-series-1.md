## Foreword
Whether or not you already are familiar with apoptOS, this blog post will talk about the project itself and what you can expect from this series. Enjoy the ride!

## What is apoptOS?
[apoptOS](https://github.com/Tix3Dev/apoptOS) an open source project currently only developed by myself, Yves Vollmeier aka Tix3Dev. It's a modern x86_64 UNIX-like microkernel-based operating system written in C and Assembly. The main purpose of it in general is to help me understand computers better whilst having fun, as I like building stuff :D

Especially I want to understand the following topics better:
- Microkernels
- UNIX-like systems
- Scheduling
- Messaging (IPC)
- Syscalls
- Userland
- ELF
- Filesystems

## What is this series about?
In this series of blog posts, I will document milestones regarding the development of apoptOS and my learning process. This will include the topics mentioned above.

_NOTE: All the blog posts are treated as snapshots in time, meaning I won't update e.g. a list of features currently available._
